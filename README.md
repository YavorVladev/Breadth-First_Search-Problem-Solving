Breadth-First_Search-Problem-Solving
Solving a problem which revolves around using BFS ( Breadth First Search )

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION :

Given an image represented by a grid of pixel values, a starting pixel (row, col), and new pixel value "p" transform all pixels connected to the starting pixel to the new pixel value.

--- Connected pixels share the same value and have a path between them by moving either: Left, Right, Up and Down.
